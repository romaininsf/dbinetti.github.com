<p>
<br><br>I've included some brief biographical information below, but please know this site isn't (just) an exercise in vanity;  I maintain it mostly to keep ahead of sites like Namyz, Spoke, etc., who are claiming identities (including mine) to support failed business models.  <br><br><br>

<img src='media/votizenlogo.png' align='right' width='200'></img>
My current project is <a href='http://www.votizen.com'>Votizen</a>, which uses social media to put political power back in the hands of voters.  Given the huge frustration with our current system and the real need for something different I'm thrilled to pursuing my dream and am lucky to be doing it.

Prior to Votizen, I spent three years in the sensor-computing space as the first marketing hire at each of two closely related companies <a href='http://www.sentilla.com'>Sentilla</a> and <a href='http://www.archrock.com'>Arch Rock</a>.  Both companies have great people and great technology and are worth keeping an eye on.<br><br> -->

Before that I founded <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050125170726/http://capitolix.com/">Capitolix</a>, which was an ASP for political campaigns.  It was a spectacular failure as a financial investment but gosh did I learn.  I paid for those lessons with three years of my life, countless nights at the office and an ulcer.  But I am so much stronger for it, as Votizen benefits every day from those travails.  <br><br><br>

That was preceded by <a href='http://www.usa.gov'>USA.gov</a>, which I co-founded with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/">Eric
Brewer</a> and a great team at the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov">GSA</a>.
USA.gov is the official US Government portal and remains one of the most useful sites on the Net.  Here's a picture with President Clinton in the Oval Office following the launch.  I was incredibly honored to be invited to the White House at all, let alone to meet the President in the Oval Office.  That said, everyone should know that I am registered as "Decline to State" because I no longer believe the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10#Application'>partisan system</a> is in the best interest of our nation.
<br><br><br>


<img src='media/quickmint.png' align='right' width='200'></img>I started my career at <a href='http://www.intuit.com'>Intuit</a> where I absorbed the basics on Product Marketing.  It was great because I learned about traditional product marketing from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Intuit-Microsoft-Revolutionized-Industry/dp/1591391369">one of the best</a>, but I also learned about marketing for startups as part of the 7-person team that created <a href='http://www.quicken.com'>Quicken.com</a>.  I still remember trying to explain to a GM how someday everyone would manage their personal finance in Internet-based applications and not on desktop software.  Almost fifteen years later and <a href="http://about.intuit.com/about_intuit/press_room/press_release/articles/2009/IntuitCompletesAcquisitionofMint.com">they finally get it</a>!
<br><br><br>

The rest is pretty boring, but essentially I worked for a bunch of startups as an independent consultant before (and during) business school at <a href='anderson.ucla.edu'>UCLA</a>.  And speaking of school, I can't neglect to mention the finest learning institution in the history of the world, the University of California at <a href='http://www.berkeley.edu'>Berkeley</a> (Go Bears!) where I went to undergrad.  I don't get back to Memorial Stadium for football games as often as I'd like, but when I'm there you'll find me in Section QQ, leading cheers.  <br><br><br>

<!-- <img src='media/vihlogo.png' align='right' width='150'></img>

My passion is singing, and I'm proud to be President of <a href='http://www.vihchorus.org'>Voices in Harmony</a>, a Men's Chorus that performs out of San Jose.  We have a spectacular Musical Director, Dr. Greg Lyne, who is world-renowned for his master classes at the St. Petersburg Conservatory in Russia.  He's conducted the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, for cripe's sake!  And we have him as our full-time Director.  So amazing...<br><br>

Last on the list, but first in my life, is my wonderful family.  I have a gorgeous and talented wife, two amazing daughters, incredibly supportive and loving parents, a brother and sister who are equally incredible, and in-laws that I adore.  I couldn't possibly be more more blessed.<br><br><br>

Sorry to bore you to death; hopefully that's enough to keep the <a href='http://www.namyz.com'>'extortionists-masquerading-as-networking-sites' </a> at bay....
