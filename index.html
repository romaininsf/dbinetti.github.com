I've included some brief biographical information below, but please know this site isn't (just) an exercise in vanity;  I maintain it mostly to keep ahead of sites like Namyz, Spoke, etc., who are using aggressive SEM to support failed business models.

My most recent project is <a href='http://www.votizen.com'>Votizen</a>, which uses social media to disrupt a political system in desperate need of disruption.  Our mission is to make the power of networks more influential than the power of checkbooks, and I am happy to report that through Votizen's <a href='http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/10/causes-acquires-votizen/'>acquisition</a> by <a href="http://www.causes.com">Causes</a> we are closer than ever to making that vision a reality.

<img src='media/senlogo.png' id='capitolix_logo'></img> Prior to Votizen, I was the first marketing hire at <a href='http://www.sentilla.com'>Sentilla</a> and <a href='http://www.archrock.com'>Arch Rock</a> (acquired by <a href="http://www.cisco.com">Cisco</a>) in enabling the "internet of things".  It's exciting to watch devices like the <a href="http://www.nest.com">NEST</a> and <a href="http://www.fitbit.com">Fitbit</a> finally catching on, following a trend that we pioneered.

Before that I founded <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050125170726/http://capitolix.com/">Capitolix</a>, which was an ASP for political campaigns.  Capitolix was an amazing learning experience that has shaped my experience on running startups, particularly on the importance of distribution and channels.  I paid for those lessons with sleepless nights, an ulcer, and more coffee than any human should consume in a lifetime.  But I wouldn't trade the experience for anything, and believe that I am a much stronger person for having gone through it.

That was preceded by <a href='http://www.usa.gov'>USA.gov</a>, which I co-founded with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/">Eric Brewer</a> and a great team at the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov">GSA</a>.  USA.gov is the official US Government portal and remains one of the most useful sites on the Net.  Here's a picture with President Clinton in the Oval Office following the launch.  I was incredibly honored to be invited to the White House at all, let alone to meet the President in the Oval Office.  That said, everyone should know that I am registered as "Decline to State" because I no longer believe the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10#Application'>partisan system</a> is in the best interest of our nation.

<p id='intuit_text'>
<img src='media/quickmint.png' id='quickmint'></img>
I started my career at <a href='http://www.intuit.com'>Intuit</a> where I absorbed the basics on Product Marketing.  It was great because I learned about traditional product marketing from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Intuit-Microsoft-Revolutionized-Industry/dp/1591391369">one of the best</a>, but I also learned about marketing for startups as part of the 7-person team that created <a href='http://www.quicken.com'>Quicken.com</a>.  I still remember trying to explain to a GM how someday everyone would manage their personal finance in Internet-based applications and not on desktop software.  Almost fifteen years later and <a href="http://about.intuit.com/about_intuit/press_room/press_release/articles/2009/IntuitCompletesAcquisitionofMint.com">they finally get it</a>!

<p id='school_text'>

The rest is pretty boring, but essentially I worked for a bunch of startups as an independent consultant before (and during) business school at <a href='http://anderson.ucla.edu'>UCLA</a>.  And speaking of school, I can't neglect to mention the finest learning institution in the history of the world, the University of California at <a href='http://www.berkeley.edu'>Berkeley</a> (Go Bears!) where I went to undergrad.  I don't get back to Memorial Stadium for football games as often as I'd like, but when I'm there you'll find me in Section QQ, leading cheers.
</p>

<p id='closing_text'>
Last on the list, but first in my life, is my wonderful family.  I have a gorgeous and talented wife, two amazing daughters, incredibly supportive and loving parents, a brother and sister who are equally incredible, and in-laws that I adore.  I couldn't possibly be more more blessed.

Sorry to bore you to death; hopefully that's enough to keep the <a href='http://www.naymz.com'>'extortionists-masquerading-as-networking-sites' </a> at bay....
